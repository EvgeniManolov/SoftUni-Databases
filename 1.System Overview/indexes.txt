A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.

Advantages: use an index for quick access to a database table specific information.  The index is a structure of the database table the value of one or more columns to sort 
The index take up disk space and reduce to add, delete, and update the line speed.  In most cases, the speed advantages of indexes for data retrieval greatly exceeds it. 

Disadvantages: too index will affect the speed of update and insert, because it requires the same update each index file.  For a frequently updated and inserted into the table, there is no need for a rarely used where the words indexed separately, small table, the cost of sorting will not be great, there is no need to create additional indexes.  In some cases, the indexing words may not be fast, for example, the index is placed in a contiguous memory space, which will increase the burden of disk read, which is optimal, it should be through the actual use of the environment to be tested.
