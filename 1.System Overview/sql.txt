SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.

The most common operation in SQL is the query, which is performed with the declarative SELECT statement.

SELECT *
 FROM  Book
 WHERE price > 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
